# Project Notes:

This is a project test from Brandon Friar.
It serches Pokemon data from https://meowing-bristle-alamosaurus.glitch.me/
There are two pages, one for searching (/) and one for results (/{id})

The Project was setup with vite and bun. It uses Sveltekit and tailwindcss.


## Run the pokemon App
```bash
bun run dev --open

visit http://localhost:5173 if project doesn't open
